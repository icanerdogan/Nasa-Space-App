<h1> Nasa Space App </h1>

<p>The "Nasa Space App" I developed using the API published by NASA - National Aeronautics and Space Administration has been completed. In the application, the most valuable images and information in the NASA database are brought together. Space images and detailed information about events in history, images obtained by Rover from the surface of Mars and constantly updated photos of the Earth by DSCOVR are included in the application.</p>

## EPIC (Earth Polychromatic Imaging Camera )
#### The EPIC API provides information on the daily imagery collected by DSCOVR's Earth Polychromatic Imaging Camera (EPIC) instrument. Uniquely positioned at the Earth-Sun Lagrange point, EPIC provides full disc imagery of the Earth and captures unique perspectives of certain astronomical events such as lunar transits using a 2048x2048 pixel CCD (Charge Coupled Device) detector coupled to a 30-cm aperture Cassegrain telescope.
